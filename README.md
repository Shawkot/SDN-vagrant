## This repo consists all the solutions for SDN (Software Defined Networking). This is a master level course and in this course I solved problems related to:
- ### using mininet emulator
- ### ONOS as the SDN controller
- ### Open virtual switch (OVS). Creating and managing ovs switches, connecting the swtiches to ONOS controller
- ### Creating flow tables, limiting access through flowrule by using OVS command line tool like ovs-ofctl
- ### Creating and configuring namespaces in linux using "ip netns" and connecting the namespaces as "host" to OVS switch
- ### Using python API and bash scripts to create network topologies in ONOS like linear topology, tree topology, etc.
- ### Using Python API to get information about topology created in ONOS like devices, hosts, links, ports and so on.
